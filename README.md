# Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 Teambuilder

Tool to create IEGS2013 teams, it generates a gecko code. You can also save and load .stf teams.

It's also a way to use the unreleased players like Saru's Miximax or Aum Nirvana

You can find template teams in the **Teams** subdirectory.

Huge thanks to AS for his help on documenting the player codes.
